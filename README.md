## **_Background_**

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I worked as a high school and middle school teacher in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. Along with teaching chemistry, 8th grade science, and computer science, I had the opportunity to start a high school wrestling team. Wrestling has been a passion of mine since childhood, and I competed all through high school and as an NCAA division 1 collegiate athlete. Seeing my high school wrestlers grow and succeed is a great source of pride, and I feel fortunate to be able to help them build skills and confidence that they can carry with them for the rest of their lives.

The school where I coach does not have any kind of standard varsity jacket or letterman jacket for athletes. I like the idea of team jackets because I think it builds a sense of team pride, so I designed a jacket that students can purchase after completing at least one full wrestling season. The jacket has different components of embroidery to reflect the athlete's achievements. For example, if they win a tournament or are voted to receive a team award, that accomplsihment is embroidered on their jacket. My idea behind the design was for the athletes to show their progress and growth. I figured older students would eventually have jackets with myriad accomplishments, so that younger students could see them and feel inspired to work toward similar goals.

In order to keep the jacket design consistent, I need to work closely with my embroiderer. It is important that the jackets follow a consistent patterns, because I intend for an athlete's jacket to last 4 years and be updated at the end of each season. In the past, we have had miscommunications that led to jackets needing to be redone and adjusted. So for this project, I wanted to design a central database where I store the wrestlers' jacket information, and can generate clear visuals of each jacket's design to send to the embroiderer.

## **_Desired Structure of Finished Product_**

This will be a website that shows the personalized jacket design for each individual athlete. I will seed a database of the data needed for the upcoming jacket order. Each piece of jacket data will fit one of 3 categories: NEW (for a brand-new jacket to be made for the first time), OLD (for the existing design of a jacket being returned), and UPDATED (to be paired with OLD and showing the updates needed to be made).

Each jacket wil be rendered as a square or tile on the main page. Users will have the ability to scroll through the designs and view each althete's jacket. NEW jackets will be alone on ther rows, while OLD and UPDATED will be shown side-by-side.

The site will also have functionality to be able to handle future orders. New jacket information can be entered on the site so that to generate new tiles, the database will not need to be completely re-seeded.
