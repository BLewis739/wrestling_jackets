## **_Background_**

Prior to my career as a software engineer, I worked as a high school and middle school teacher in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. Along with teaching chemistry, 8th grade science, and computer science, I had the opportunity to start a high school wrestling team. Wrestling has been a passion of mine since childhood, and I competed all through high school and as an NCAA division 1 collegiate athlete. Seeing my high school wrestlers grow and succeed is a great source of pride, and I feel fortunate to be able to help them build skills and confidence that they can carry with them for the rest of their lives.

The school where I coach does not have any kind of standard varsity jacket or letterman jacket for athletes. I like the idea of team jackets because I think it builds a sense of team pride, so I designed a jacket that students can purchase after completing at least one full wrestling season. The jacket has different components of embroidery to reflect the athlete's achievements. For example, if they win a tournament or are voted to receive a team award, that accomplsihment is embroidered on their jacket. My idea behind the design was for the athletes to show their progress and growth. I figured older students would eventually have jackets with myriad accomplishments, so that younger students could see them and feel inspired to work toward similar goals.

In order to keep the jacket design consistent, I need to work closely with my embroiderer. It is important that the jackets follow a consistent patterns, because I intend for an athlete's jacket to last 4 years and be updated at the end of each season. In the past, we have had miscommunications that led to jackets needing to be redone and adjusted. So for this project, I wanted to design a central database where I store the wrestlers' jacket information, and can generate clear visuals of each jacket's design to send to the embroiderer.

## **_App Structure_**

The page is meant to be used and viewed by the embroiderer. On the home page, there is a button that allows the user to show all jackets in the current order. As long as the screen width is at least 1230 pixels wide, then two jacket images should appear side-by-side. The first picture shows the jacket as it should look after its embroidery is updated. The second picture shows the jacket in its current state. This allows the embroiderer to see exactly what changes need to be made. Brand-new jackets are compared to a blank jacket template.

There are additional pages that allow the user to add jackets, edit jackets, and delete jackets. On each of these pages, a template of the jacket
